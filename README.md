# Start-Menu

Start Menu is a web based version of the local computer's common Start Menu.  The application locates the Start Menu folder and then 
retrieves the full file path for all programs in the folder and sub-folders.  This data is stored in a local database and used to
populate the web page with icons for each program.  Clicking on an icon will launch the program from the local computer's desktop and
update the run count that tracks the number of times the program has been launched from the web page.  Finally, the web page utilizes 
a default icon.  However, the Settings menu option can be used to upload customized program icon images.
